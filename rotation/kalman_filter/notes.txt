Sanity Checks --

Basic Madgwick Complementary Filter --
  Zero rotation. Converges.
  1-Axis Rotation. Converges for x,y,z
    the non-zero 'x' magnetic field requirement is crucial
    the derivation of the simplified gradient assumes this
    if you have a 'y' component but no 'x' then only the z matters...
    and if you have a zero z component... it doesn't matter how you rotate there.
    it would look like the magnetic field didn't matter.
  3D Rotation.
    Converges without noise.

MCF with Magnetic Distortion Compensation --
  3D Rotation
    Converges without noise within 40 frames at 100Hz (0.5s) then stays locked.

MCF + MDC + Gyro Bias Estimation --
  3D Rotation
    Converges without noise within 40 frames at 100Hz (0.5s) then stays locked.

Add in zero mean gyro noise to the tune of 3 degrees per second per axis, iid.
  3D Rotation
    Converges without noise within 40 frames at 100Hz (0.5s) then stays locked.

Add in zero mean gyro noise to the tune of 180 degrees per second per axis, iid.
  3D Rotation
    Converges but is buffetted about by noise throughout the simulation.

Add in gyro bias
  3D Rotation
    Converges for bias even up to the 180 dps range iid in all axes.
    Beta, Zeta BOTH need to be tuned to match the scale of spread, bias, of course.

Add in zero mean accel noise

Add in low frequency accel oscillation

Add in time jitter and interpolation

Show me inertial drift (doens't need to be animated) to understand the timescale.

Write out a simple drone model
Simulate it
Add in a pid controller
