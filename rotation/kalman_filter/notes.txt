  Zero rotation. Converges.
  1-Axis Rotation. Converges for x,y,z
    the non-zero 'x' magnetic field requirement is crucial
    the derivation of the simplified gradient assumes this
    if you have a 'y' component but no 'x' then only the z matters...
    and if you have a zero z component... it doesn't matter how you rotate there.
    it would look like the magnetic field didn't matter.
  3D Rotation.
    Converges without noise.
