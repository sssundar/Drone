Sanity Checks --

Zero rotation. Converges.
1-Axis Rotation. Converges for x,y,z
  the non-zero 'x' magnetic field requirement is crucial
  the derivation of the simplified gradient assumes this
  if you have a 'y' component but no 'x' then only the z matters...
  and if you have a zero z component... it doesn't matter how you rotate there.
  it would look like the magnetic field didn't matter.
3D Rotation.
  Looks like we're converging but our rotation is backwards.
  I have a sign error somewhere.
